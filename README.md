A little bit more about Molly:

> She is a full-time mother of two with a passion for helping people. She finds immense fulfillment in teaching ESL at the local library while balancing duties at home. She builds relationships quickly, preferring to hand-make cards for people rather than buy them, builds lifelong friendships working alongside adults teaching them English, stays up late to take care of her family, and insists that she makes plenty of time in her day for her kids to garden and teach them about life. 

Her frustrations with the current system:

* Repetition/inefficiency of tasks
* Making sense of raw data
* Limitations on data filtering
* Lengthy technology interaction

How is the backlog ordered?
=================

The key aspect of backlog ordering we took into account over all others was MVP. This is expressed through our choice to put the main time-logging functionality ahead of most other non-core backlog items. Initial comps of the product was chosen as the most important backlog item, because giving the stakeholders an idea of how the product will look and function is of great value to them. Some of the items at the bottom of the project backlog
are there because of dependencies and non-essential functions.  Nevertheless, they constitute functionality that would be appreciated by stakeholders.  All in all, MVP, dependencies, stakeholder involvement, and time constraints played the largest factor in ordering the backlog to its current condition.
